    "description": "Amazon WorkMail is releasing two new actions: 'GetMailboxDetails' and 'UpdateMailboxQuota'. They add insight into how much space is used by a given mailbox (size) and what its limit is (quota). A mailbox quota can be updated, but lowering the value will not influence WorkMail per user charges. For a closer look at the actions please visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html"
