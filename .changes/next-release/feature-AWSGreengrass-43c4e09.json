    "description": "Greengrass group UID and GID settings can now be configured to use a provided default via FunctionDefaultConfig. If configured, all Lambda processes in your deployed Greengrass group will by default start with the provided UID and/or GID, rather than by default starting with UID \"ggc_user\" and GID \"ggc_group\" as they would if not configured. Individual Lambdas can also be configured to override the defaults if desired via each object in the Functions list of your FunctionDefinitionVersion."
