    "description": "This release adds PrivateLink support to your AWS SFTP server endpoint, enabling the customer to access their SFTP server within a VPC, without having to traverse the internet. Customers can now can create a server and specify an option whether they want the endpoint to be hosted as public or in their VPC, and with the in VPC option, SFTP clients and users can access the server only from the customer's VPC or from their on-premises environments using DX or VPN. This release also relaxes the SFTP user name requirements to allow underscores and hyphens."
