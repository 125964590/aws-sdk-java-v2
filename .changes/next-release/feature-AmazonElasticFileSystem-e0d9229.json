    "description": "Customers can now use the EFS Infrequent Access (IA) storage class to more cost-effectively store larger amounts of data in their file systems. EFS IA is cost-optimized storage for files that are not accessed every day. You can create a new file system and enable Lifecycle Management to automatically move files that have not been accessed for 30 days from the Standard storage class to the IA storage class."
